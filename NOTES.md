# improvements

lots of repetitions, redundancy.
    - file being opened/closed
    - reading file size
    - reading the json

# syntax

```sh
$ mimi remind "foo bar" 6/2/2026
$ mimi remind "foo bar" 6/2/2026 8:30
$ mimi remind "foo bar" 1d
$ mimi remind "foo bar" 3w 3 (3 specifies repeat)
$ mimi remind "foo bar" 1y 0
$ mimi remind "foo bar" -1 (remind every time opened)
```
